# Crop Recommendation System üåæ  

The **Crop Recommendation System** is a machine learning-powered web application designed to assist farmers in making informed decisions about which crops to plant. By analyzing critical environmental and soil parameters, the system provides personalized, data-driven recommendations to optimize agricultural productivity.  

This project combines the power of **data science**, **software development**, and **agriculture technology** to create a practical solution for farmers, empowering them with actionable insights for sustainable farming practices.

## üöÄ Key Features  
### üåç Multi-Parameter Analysis  
Our model utilizes **six vital parameters**:  
- **Nitrogen (N)**  
- **Phosphorus (P)**  
- **Potassium (K)**  
- **pH**  
- **Humidity**  
- **Temperature**  
- **Rainfall**  

By incorporating these factors, the system delivers accurate, region-specific crop recommendations tailored to the user‚Äôs soil and climate conditions.  

### üîç Comprehensive Data Handling  
- The dataset was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/atharvaingle/crop-recommendation-dataset).  
- **Data Collection**: Ensured by **Jatin**, ensuring high-quality, diverse, and relevant data.  
- **Data Preprocessing & Visualization**: Managed by **Rahul**, who transformed raw data into actionable insights for model training.  

### ü§ñ Machine Learning Model  
- Algorithm: **Random Forest**  
- Model selection, training, and testing were conducted collaboratively by **Pramath** and **Saksham**.  
- Assisted by **Kuldeep**, the team fine-tuned the model to achieve high accuracy and reliability, ensuring optimal recommendations.  

### üåê Full-Stack Development  
- **Frontend Development**: Designed using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** for an intuitive and user-friendly interface.  
- **Backend Development**: Built with **Flask** to integrate the machine learning model seamlessly with the application.
